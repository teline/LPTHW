Rules for If-Statements
1. Every if must have an else
2. Always put a die function and error message in an unused else statement
3. Never nest if-statements more than 2 deep. Move the second if into a new function
4. Treats if-statements like paragraphs. blank lines before and after the if elif else group
5. Use simple boolean tests. Move calculations to earlier in the function

Rules for Loops
1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever
2. Use a for loop for everything else

Tips for Debugging
1. Do not use a debugger
2. Use print statements to find where it goes wrong
3. Test code as you write it
